running slim version
--------------------

This is a partial rewrite of the 0.2 main branch version. The purpose is to
reduce code size and code complexity by removing some of the enterprise
patters used. Were removed: the domain model, the repository service and all
the data-mappers, the identity service, the memento. To access the database
are now used rowgateway and finder patterns (much smaller).
