running slim version
--------------------

This is a partial rewrite of the 0.2 version. The purpose is to reduce code
size and complexity by removing some of the enterprise patters used.
Were removed: the domain model, the repository service and all the
data-mappers, the identity-map service, the memento. To access the database
now are used the rowgateway and finder patterns (much smaller code), or
directly the Qt tablemodel classes.

All the existing feature were migrated to the new code.

The database filename has changed: the extension was *.db3, now is *.db. Please
rename the file to have an upgrade at the next program start.

New features:
Settings stored not in database anymore but in a platform-depending location.
Bigger icons and configurable toolbar layout.
