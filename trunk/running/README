Running
-------

A simple program for runners based on a calendar and an event list. The user 
can record running workouts and later can get statistics about mileage, average 
speed, shoes.

Made with Nokia Qt library, Qt Creator IDE, MinGW/GNU compiler, SQLite database 
engine and a few other tools. The program build and run on Windows, Linux and 
Mac OS X. Data are saved on a SQLite file using Qt internal sql plugin. The 
program is usable, but not tested in daily usage.

Notable features are:
The program is multi-platform: it runs on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.
The program is multi-language: the interface is translated in English and 
Italian.
The database is auto-upgraded by the program between versions.

The author wrote the program as an exercize to learn the Qt framework. The 0.2 
release implements some enterprise patterns like Domain Model, Services, Object 
Repository and Data Mappers. From the 0.3 release these were removed in favor 
of a much slimmer code.

TODO
Add more than one event per day.
Drag and drop on the calendar.
Add multi-sport: add other sports beside running (bike, swimming, ecc).
Add plugins for import events from gps-sets or other programs.
Add plugins for export data to spreadsheets, html, blogs.

KNOWN BUGS
Sometimes the correct order of intervals is not saved. The user has to reenter 
the order and update the event.
