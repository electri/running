Running
-------

A simple program for runners based on a calendar and an event list. The user 
can record running workouts and later can get statistics about mileage, average 
speed, shoes.

Notable features are:
The program is multi-platform: it runs on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.
The program is multi-language: the interface is translated in English and 
Italian.
The database is auto-upgraded by the program between versions.

The author wrote the program as an exercize to learn the Qt framework. The 0.2 
release implements some enterprise patterns like Domain Model, Services, Object 
Repository and Data Mappers. From the 0.3 release these were removed in favor 
of a much slimmer code.

TODO
Add more than one event per day.
Drag and drop on the calendar.
Add multi-sport: add other sports beside running (bike, swimming, ecc).
Add plugins for import events from gps-sets or other programs.
Add plugins for export data to spreadsheets, html, blogs.

KNOWN BUGS
Sometimes the correct order of intervals is not saved. The user has to reenter 
the order and resave the event.
